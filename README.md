A PS3DumpChecker fork
==============

This is a fork of Swizzy's PS3DumpChecker program to allow the checking of the partial NAND/eMMC dumps that PS3Xploit creates.

Huge thanks to Littlebalup's PyPS3Checker for the offsets making this project possible.

Status:

PS3Xploit 239MB partial NAND: ✔️

Full 250MB NAND: ✔️

NOR: ✔️

Super Slim(CECH-4XXX) NOR: ✔️

(Make sure to use the SuperSlim.cfg file instead of the default.cfg file if you're going to check your Super Slim NOR dump.)

PS3Xploit 239MB partial eMMC: ✔️

(Make sure to use the eMMC.cfg file instead of the default.cfg file if you're going to check your eMMC dump.)

This project will hopefully be updated in the future with better 4000 series checking, since it shows false positives.

I would be very thankful if anybody with a 4000 series PS3 sends their dump to me, with the personal information censored of course. It would improve the accuracy of the program strongly.

NOTE: Nobody takes ANY responsibility for any false negative/false positive given by this app, the responsibilty that your dump is valid is YOURS and yours alone.

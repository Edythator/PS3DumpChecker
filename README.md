A PS3DumpChecker fork
==============

This is a fork of Swizzy's PS3DumpChecker program to allow the checking of the partial NAND/eMMC dumps that PS3Xploit creates.

Huge thanks to Littlebalup's PyPS3Checker for the offsets making this project possible.

Status:

PS3Xploit 239MB partial NAND: ✔️

Full 250MB NAND: ✔️

NOR: ✔️

Super Slim(CECH-4XXX) NOR: ✔️

(Make sure to use the SuperSlim.cfg file instead of the default.cfg file if you're going to check your Super Slim NOR dump.)

PS3Xploit 239MB partial eMMC: ✔️

(Make sure to use the SuperSlim.cfg file instead of the default.cfg file if you're going to check your Super Slim eMMC dump.)

NOTE: Nobody takes ANY responsibility for any false negative/false positive given by this app, the responsibilty that your dump is valid is YOURS and yours alone.
